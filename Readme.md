# Remote timer

This project aims to simplify keeping the time for speakers during a presentation. It consists of two parts: a remote control and a timer. The remote control is a simple web page that can be accessed from any device with a web browser. The timer is a small device that can be controlled by the remote control. /copilot

This project uses rust for the backend service and svelte for the frontend. The communication between the remote control and the timer is done using websockets.
